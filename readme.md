#Project Tracker
##Author: Keith Blackwelder
##Description
Project Tracker, is a app to help with productivity on any project. Mainly focused around tracking development projects like building web apps and websites.
A person will be able to create master projects, in which he or she can create sub-projects.
Inside of each project will be actions you can take like creating new issues, writing your todo's, uploading documentation, and writing daily project notes to help keep track of the small things.
You will also be able to see things like time spent on that project, who is the creator, requestor, watchers, and the person or persons who are in charge of the project.

## Development and Build
I will be using React to build the front-end of the app.
I will be using node js and express on the server.
I wil use Mongo DB for data storage.
